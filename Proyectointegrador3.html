<section id="introducción" class="level1">
<h1>Introducción</h1>
<p>Los alumnos de este Proyecto de Trabajo Integrador somos parte de la cátedra “Estadística” de las carreras Licenciatura en Economía y Licenciatura en Administración de la Facultad de Economía y Administración. Para poder motivar a nuestros estudiantes en la potencialidad del análisis Exploratorio de Datos, discutir la importancia de determinados indicadores, crear tablas adecuadas, construir gráficos útilies y analizar estadísticas descriptivas, trabajamos con el Índice de Desarrollo Humano (IDH) que se mide en todos los países del mundo a lo largo de los últimos 40 años. Seleccionamos esta base de datos conocida, para poder enfocarnos y profundizar en el desarrollo de las herramientas aprendidas del lenguaje R. Por otra parte, decidimos ampliar la mirada a una nueva fuente de información que nos permita acceder a indicadores que nos ayuden a comprender la realidad Argentina a nivel regional, particularmente, la pobreza. Este indicador no se encuentra en la base de datos de IDH, por lo que decidimos trabajar con información que brinda el Banco Mundial, ya que es una de las bases más consultadas para realizar reportes de la evolución de los países en un gran número de indicadores económicos. Por último, queríamos investigar acerca de la inflación Argentina del último tiempo. Esos datos se descargaron de la página del INDEC.</p>
<section id="objetivo-del-estudio" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objetivo-del-estudio">Objetivo del estudio</h2>
<p>El objetivo de este estudio es caracterizar y comparar la situación actual de Argentina y su progresión a lo largo de los últimos 30 años, en cuanto al Índice de Desarrollo Humano y describir la situación con otros países de la región en cuanto a la pobreza. Por último, describir el proceso inflacionario de nuestro país.<br>
Las preguntas que se plantean son:</p>
<ul>
<li>¿Cómo es la evolución Argentina en cuánto al IDH? ¿Cuál es nuestro status a nivel mundial? ¿Y a nivel regional?</li>
<li>¿Existe relación entre la pobreza y el IDH en los países de la región en los últimos 30 años? ¿Y en el último año?</li>
<li>¿Cómo ha sido la inflación en Argentina en el último tiempo? ¿Se puede predecir los niveles de inflación para lo que resta del 2024?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="descripción-del-conjunto-de-datos" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="descripción-del-conjunto-de-datos">Descripción del conjunto de datos</h2>
<p>Utilizamos como insumo para trabajar el IDH, proveniente de los estudios realizados por el <a href="https://hdr.undp.org/">Programa de Desarrollo de las Naciones Unidas</a>. Los datos fueron descargados en formato .csv; luego se preprocesó la base en R para su posterior tratamiento. Mientras que para acceder a los datos de pobreza e inflación, trabajamos con la base de datos del <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators">Banco Mundial</a>. En este sentido, nos pareció desafiante trabajar con la API (application programming interface) con la que cuenta R para acceder a los indicadores necesarios de la página web del banco mundial, logrando realizar un trabajo reproducible a partir del código empleado, en lugar de descargar un archivo y modificarlo a nuestras necesidades. Finalmente, integramos ambas bases para poder trabajar mancomunadamente y responder preguntas de carácter global, así como también comparar y visualizar patrones a nivel regional.&nbsp; Cabe destacar que se incorporó la variable Region, que tomamos de la página del Banco Mundial, ya que la base de datos de IDH de Naciones Unidas, tenia muchos países con valores faltantes.</p>
<p>La unidad experimental de la base de datos es la combinación país y año. Al ser 193 países que cuentan con IDH y tomar la información desde el año 1990 hasta el 2022 inclusive (33 años), queda un total de 6.369 filas (<code>IDH_wide.xlsx</code>)</p>
<p>Las variables estudiadas son 12 para IDH:<br>
<strong>iso3c:</strong> código del país.<br>
<strong>country:</strong> nombre del país.<br>
<strong>hdicode:</strong> es la variable ordinal que indica la categoría a la que pertenece el país, según su IDH.<br>
<strong>region:</strong> Región en la que se encuentra el país.<br>
<strong>hdi_rank_2022:</strong> ranking de IDH para el año 2022.<br>
<strong>year:</strong> año.<br>
<strong>hdi:</strong> Índice de Desarrollo Humano, que es el promedio geométrico de tres indicadores (LE; GNIPC; promedio(EYS; MYS)).<br>
<strong>le:</strong> Esperanza de vida al nacer (años)<br>
<strong>eys:</strong> Años esperados de escolaridad (años)<br>
<strong>mys:</strong> Promedio de años de escolaridad (años)<br>
<strong>gnipc:</strong> Ingreso nacional bruto per cápita (2017 PPA$)<br>
<strong>pobreza:</strong> Tasa de pobreza de 6,85 dólares al día (PPA 2017) (% de la población)<br>
</p>
<p>También se trabajó con la base de datos de inflación del INDEC para observar la inflación en Argentina. La base de datos quedó conformada por 159 filas (desde enero de 2011 a febrero 2024) y 2 columnas (período e inflación). La información se fue tomando anualmente de dsitintas bases, y luego se compilaron en una única base de datos (<code>mes.año.inf.xlsx</code>)</p>

<section id="preparación-y-exploración-de-los-datos" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preparación-y-exploración-de-los-datos">Preparación y exploración de los datos</h2>
<p>La base de datos de IDH de la ONU descargada, no se encontraba en condiciones de trabajarla inmediatamente, ya que tenía filas que no utilizaríamos (regiones que no correspondían a los países que deseábamos estudiar), muchas variables que no eran de nuestro interés, y variables necesarias para poder unir a la base del banco mundial con otro nombre. Además, las variables que si queríamos estudiar, se descargan en formato “a lo ancho”, por lo que tuvimos que preprocesar la base para poder trabajar y dejarla en el formato que necesitábamos “a lo largo”.<br>
En cuanto a los datos faltantes, para los análisis descriptivos a nivel global, como así también para estudios inferenciales, se continuó con los datos disponibles, eliminando los datos faltantes.<br>
Además de las variables descargadas, se generaron 3 variables auxiliares continuas para un posterior análisis del IDH:<br>
<strong>hdi_he.ec:</strong> IDH teniendo en cuenta solo los indicadores de salud y economía.<br>
<strong>hdi_he.ed:</strong> IDH teniendo en cuenta solo los indicadores de salud y educación.<br>
<strong>hdi_ec.ed:</strong> IDH teniendo en cuenta solo los indicadores de economía y educación.<br>

<section id="descargando-y-transformando-la-base-de-datos-de-idh" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="descargando-y-transformando-la-base-de-datos-de-idh">Descargando y transformando la base de datos de IDH</h2>
<p>Primero seleccionamos las columnas relevantes. Luego eliminamos las filas con datos faltantes en la variable hdicode., garantizando que solo nos quedaríamos con aquellos países que contaban con registros de HDI en los años estudiados.</p>
<p>Los datos descargados estaban en forma “wide”, lo que significa que cada columna representa la combinación de una variable por año y cada fila representa un país. Esto implica que cada fila representa múltiples observaciones en el sentido de que tenemos datos de varias variables*año para cada fila. Para rectificar esto, necesitamos cambiar la forma de los datos de formato “ancho” a formato “largo”. Utilizamos la función <code>pivot_longer()</code> del paquete <code>tidyr</code>. También separamos el nombre de la variable y el año, ya que teníamos el registro de 6 variables (hdi, le, eys, mys, gnipc), a lo largo de los años. De esta forma generamos la base IDH_ord</p>
<p>Por último, y para dejar cada variable por separado y una variable para los años, reorganizamos la tabla para que cada variable se convirtiera en una columna, lo que facilita la comparación a lo largo del tiempo, a partir de la función <code>pivot_wider()</code>. De esta manera generamos la tabla IDH_wide, que es la que está en condiciones de juntarse con las otras dos.</p>

<p>Al observar estos datos, se pueden identificar tendencias a lo largo del tiempo. Se observa una tendencia general al alza en la inflación, lo que significa que los precios tienden a aumentar con el tiempo.</p>
<p>Además de la tendencia general, también se observan picos notables en ciertos años, como 2014, 2019, 2022 y 2023. Estos picos representan momentos en los que la inflación experimentó un aumento significativo en comparación con los meses circundantes.</p>
<p>El año 2023 es especialmente destacable, ya que registró el nivel más alto de inflación en todo el período analizado, alcanzando un preocupante 25.47%. Este dato resalta la gravedad de la situación inflacionaria en Argentina durante ese año.</p>

<p>Para ayudar a comprender mejor los patrones y las fluctuaciones en los datos de inflación, se utilizó un método de descomposición de series temporales. Este método separa los datos en diferentes componentes, como tendencia, estacionalidad y error. Al visualizar estos componentes, se pueden identificar patrones estacionales recurrentes y otros factores que contribuyen al comportamiento inflacionario a lo largo del tiempo.</p>
